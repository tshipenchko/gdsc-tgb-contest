# gdsc-tgb-contest
I don't really love taking only an interview. It's kinda boring for you and me. <br/> 
So I decided to make a contest for the GDSC TGB. I hope you enjoy it! <br/>
Btw, I'm not a native English speaker, so please forgive me if there are any mistakes in this README.md file. <br/>
Btw x2, this text was created by GitHub Copilot. I'm not sure if it's good or not, but I hope it's good. <br/>

## Update
The contest is over. Now you can publicly publish your solutions. If you have suggestions for new tasks, you can open issue with the `contest-task` label.

## Rules
 - Contest tasks are located in the `issues` on this repository with special `contest-task` label.
 - You have to start with the first task and then move to the next one.
 - You can choose any task you want, after you complete the previous one. 
 - You are free to ask any questions about the task in the comments.
 - ~~I recommend you to don't publish publicly your solution before the end of the contest.~~
 - To share your solution, you can create a new ~~private~~ repository on your GitHub account and add me as a viewer. My GitHub username is `@tshipenchko`.

## Why
I want to see your skills in real solving of problems. To solve problems, you need to know how to use Google, StackOverflow, and other resources. <br/>
Furthermore, I want to see your skills in writing code: code style, structure, comments, and other things. 
Also, to make commits, you should investigate how this code works, find bugs and be able to contribute.

## How to run
 - Create virtual environment (optional): `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
 - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Set environment variables: `export TOKEN=<your_token>`
 - Run the project: `python -m bot`
